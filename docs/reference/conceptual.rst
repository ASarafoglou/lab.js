Conceptual overview
===================

The core idea of **lab.js** is that experiments can be broken down into
**components** that are fundamentally alike. From these building blocks, even
complex experiments can then be constructed.

For example, a typical experiment can probably be broken down into several
**screens** which are presented to participants sequentially. Each screen likely
needs some preparation before it can be presented (e.g. preloading of content),
before it can be run. It might wait for a response and then end, or terminate
automatically after a certain time period, or both.

On a higher level, screens might be combined into **sequences**: The experiment
itself is most likely a sequence of screens, but on a finer level, trials are
also often composed of several distinct phases that appear in sequence, for
example a fixation cross that precedes stimulus presentation, and an ISI that
follows it.
Sequences, too, need to be prepared (and any components they contain), and when
they are run, they execute any contained content.

The two aforementioned components, screens and sequences, make up the core of
lab.js. Even though they represent fundamentally different building blocks, they
behave very similarly: As just noted, both are **prepared** and **run** in a
similar way. In addition, they share much of the same internal structure.
Specifically, both emit and are sensitive to several types of *events*, of which
preparation and presentation are just two.
These similarities are reflected in the internal structure of lab.js, in which
all components are descendants of the same core prototype, often with very few
additional changes.
