Working together

**We would like ours to be an open, welcoming and supportive community, and are committed to making this possible.** We expect all members to meet our `Code of Conduct`_ in all their interactions, to be excellent to one another and to help others do the same.

The `p5.js community statement <https://p5js.org/community/>`_, the `Apache Foundation's guidelines <https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct>`_ and the `Public Lab Code of Conduct <https://publiclab.org/conduct>`_ provide a blueprint for the kind of project we strive to be.

Please make sure you understand and accept the terms outlined in the code of conduct; if you have questions or suggestions, please do let us know. **Welcome to our community!**
