Contribute
==========

**Thank you for considering contributing** to ``lab.js``! Whether you have an idea or suggestion, if you have spotted a bug or even have a correction handy, whether you would like to add new features or documentation, or improve what's already there, **your help is very welcome** indeed. Similarly, if you enjoy the project and would like to become a contributor, you are very warmly invited to join; we'd be glad to help you find a contribution that fits your interests and resources.

Together, **we're building a tool to help scientists understand behavior and cognition in its many forms, and to conduct their research efficiently and transparently.** We believe the world needs this project:

* Browser-based studies have been difficult to build. **We'd like to make data collection in the browser accessible to everyone.**
* Commercial tools impede sharing of research material, and thereby hamper open, reproducable research; **our goal is to make sure that studies can be shared, reproduced and extended.**
* Behavioral research is moving towards large-scale, collaborative projects. **The future needs open, extensible, cross-platform research tools.** That's what we're creating here!
