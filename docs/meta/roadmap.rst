Roadmap
=======

The library aims at biannual stable releases in a tick-tock pattern. The
summer release will be allowed to break backward compatibility if necessary,
but the API should remain stable for the remainder of the year, though features
may be added. This very similar to the concept of `semantic versioning
<http://semver.org/>`_.
