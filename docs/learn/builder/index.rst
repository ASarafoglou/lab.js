Get started building studies
============================

**The lab.js builder is the easiest way to get started designing studies. You'll build experiments using a graphical, drag-and-drop interface.** We'd like to show it to you in this short tutorial -- you'll have your first study running in less than an hour.

  :subtitle: **You'll need an up-to-date browser** to make full use of the interface.

  We recommend `Firefox`_ or `Chrome`_ in their most recent version. Both update automatically, so **if you're using either one already, you should be all set**.

  The **studies you build will run on a much wider range of browsers** and devices without problems -- it's just the interface that needs some `very recent features`_. We're doing cutting-edge stuff here!

Thanks so much for checking out ``lab.js``! We would love to support you and your work. This tutorial will walk you through the main features of our software.

Throughout this tutorial, you'll be using the `builder interface`_ in your browser. It's free to use, and always will be.

We'd love to help you if you have any questions; likewise, if you have suggestions for things we could explain better, :ref:`we're there for you <support>`.
