Get started with the builder
============================

**The lab.js builder is the easiest way to get started designing studies. It's a graphical, drag-and-drop interface for assembling experiments and questionnaires.** We'd like to show it to you in this short tutorial.

You'll need a basic knowledge of ``HTML``, which is what we'll use to control how things appear on screen. If you're fearless, you might pick up the very basics in the tutorial itself, but if you're not quite sure, it might be a good investment to take a moment to (re-)familiarize yourself with it now, or after working through the tutorial. `Codecademy`_ have an excellent `tutorial`_ on the matter which we recommend wholeheartedly.

As you progress through the tutorial, we'll touch upon ``CSS`` (which will help you change how things look) and JavaScript (to change how things work), but see -- we're already getting ahead of ourselves.

With that, **let's get started!**

.. hint::

  If you're an experienced coder already and would like full, fine-grained control over your study, you can use the library to :ref:`program experiments in JavaScript from scratch <tutorial/code>`. However, if you're just learning ``lab.js``, we believe that you'll benefit from building your first study using the interface to get a first impression of how things work together. This will help you even if you decide to switch to pure code later -- and maybe you'll find you don't need to!
