    <p>You'll get the most out of the builder by using <a href="https://getfirefox.com" className="font-weight-bold">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/" className="font-weight-bold">Chrome</a> (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">compatible browsers and versions</a>). Private browsing mode may disable essential features even on these browsers &ndash; please check whether it is active.</p>
    <p>The studies you design will work fine on a much larger range of systems &ndash; it's just the builder interface that requires more capabilities.</p>
