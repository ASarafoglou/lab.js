**`lab.js` is a toolkit for constructing browser-based online experiments in
Javascript.** It vastly simplifies the construction of experiments by taking
care of stimulus display and timing, response collection, and data storage. The
library builds on the idea that experiments are constructed from individual
*components*: The stimuli themselves, and sequences and loops that provide
structure to the experiment.

can download via the [latest
release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest). With that in
hand, please be invited to take a look at the
[tutorial](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html), which
will walk you through building an experiment.

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!
