**`lab.js` is a toolkit for constructing browser-based online experiments in
Javascript.** It vastly simplifies the construction of experiments by taking
care of stimulus display and timing, response collection, and data storage. The
library builds on the idea that experiments are constructed from individual
*components*: The stimuli themselves, and sequences and loops that provide
structure to the experiment.
