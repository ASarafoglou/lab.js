**`lab.js` is a toolkit for constructing browser-based online experiments in Javascript.** It vastly simplifies the construction of experiments by taking care of stimulus display and timing, response collection, and data storage. The library builds on the idea that experiments are constructed from *blocks* of content: Individual stimuli of whichever nature, and sequences or more complex arrangements of these.
