**`lab.js` is a tool for constructing browser-based studies** built for (but
not limited to) the social and cognitive sciences. Studies can be assembled
using a graphical builder, or through code. In either case, `lab.js` takes care
of study presentation, response collection and data storage, while providing
the greatest possible flexibility with regard to study design.

### Get started

The [**graphical builder interface**](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com) is the
easiest way to create studies, and the best place to start. The tutorial
will walk you through [building your first study, step by
step](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

If you prefer working directly with code, you can build studies using the
[**JavaScript library**](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html).
Everything you need is bundled in the *starter kit*, which is [provided with
every release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
There is also a tutorial to [help you get started](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### Find help

The easiest and quickest way to find help is to [join our **Slack
channel**](https://slackin-nmbrcrnchrs.herokuapp.com/), where there's someone
around to discuss things and help out most of the time. You're welcome to just
join and say hello!

### Keep up-to-date

If you'd like to keep in the loop regarding the development, please [subscribe
to our **newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/co0K9r) to receive very occasional
updates and release notifications.

The students and teaching assistants in the graduate course *Research Methods
in Cognitive Psychology* at the University of Koblenz-Landau inspire the
continued development of this software, have provided countless valuable
insights, and sparked many of the ideas embodied in this project through
questions and discussions.

#### Institutional support

If you would like to support development, the easiest way is to **host a
workshop**. We'll gladly show you and your colleagues how to build experiments
using this software, and build your favorite paradigm together! We are also open
to **consulting** if you are looking for a particular feature — please don't
hesitate to get in touch so that we can discuss things in more detail.

### Join in!

**We would love to have you as part of this project** — whether you have new
ideas, suggestions, or would just like to muck in, please be warmly invited to
do so: This is an open project! We'd be glad to hear from you, to discuss ideas
and approaches, and to get you going. There's an [overview of the code and
intro to the build
process](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute.html) in the
documentation if you're interested, but as always, we'd be happy to help you get
started.

**If you're searching for a place to contribute, please do let us know**:
There's always things to do, and we'd be glad to help you find something that
fits your interests and resources. If you're writing a tool that might
interoperate with this one, we're more than happy to link things up; if you're
looking to extend or build on this project, we'd be thrilled to provide a
stepping stone for you!

We expect all contributors to conform to the [Software Carpentry **Code of
Conduct**](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/), and to be excellent to one
another.

* The **builder**, the graphical interface used to build experiments,
  is provided under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public
  License](/builder/license).

The studies you build based on the library, and those you create using the
builder, are always your own, and you are free to distribute them as you see
fit. When studies include the core library files, these files alone are governed
